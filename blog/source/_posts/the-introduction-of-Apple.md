***Apple has been a very different company from the start.Their approaches to user interfaces and design aesthetics have always been innovative and revered by both users and critics alike.
There is a level of polish in Apple’s products not found in most of its competitor’s devices.Their philosophy is not to sell you all the latest and greatest functions and components, but rather a comprehensive and cohesive package that is beautiful to look at and intuitive to use***
